map of how to game will work:

game class should run the entire thing.
    sets up the players and starting stacks 
    chooses whether or not to run a hand

    runHand runs and entire hand {
        # this should do a lot of delegating to helper methods
        
        setUp
            sets up the starting state
            sets up blinds as current bets
            sets both player's status to live

        runPreFlop
            # runs all preflop action

        runPostStreet
            pass in street = flop

            deals flop

            asks first player for betchoice
                if sbPlayer.betOption() === "check" {
                    bbPlayer.betOption()
                }
            function Player.prototype.betOption(street){
                if (choice === "bet")
                    otherPlayer.facingBet(betsize)
                if (choice === "check) return "check"
            }
            function Player.prototype.faceBet(betsize, street) {
                if (choice === "fold")
                    player.status = "folded"

                if (choice === "call")
                    player.stack -= (betSize - currentBet)
                    pot += (betSize - currentBet)

                if (choice === "raise")
                    pot += raiseSize - betSize
                    currentBet = raiseSize
                    otherPlayer.facingBet(raiseSize)
            }

            checks to see if either player has folded
            finishes resets currentBet of both players to 0
            


        runPostStreet
            pass in street = turn

        runPostStreet
            pass in street = river
            
        endHand
            complete all hand mechanics
    }
